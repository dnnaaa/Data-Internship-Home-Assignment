Do you believe that a world-class team with relentless drive can surpass even their own high expectations?We do! But we also realize this job isnât for everyone. What we do isnât easy but you donât take the easy path. We are seeking a highly motivated, innovative, and confident individuals to join the CPU Architecture and Performance Team; we are a group that is driving advanced exploration for next generation iPhone, iPad, and Mac CPU architectures. Key Qualifications â¢ Experience and knowledge of CPU architecture and micro-architecture concepts, expertise in one or multiple CPU focused areas.â¢ Ability to identify performance bottlenecks in workloads, craft ideas to solve them and implement those ideas in the performance simulator.â¢ Proficient in C/C++ and a scripting language such as Perl or Python.â¢ Knowledge and experience with common industry performance benchmarks andworkloads. Description The CPU Platform Architecture team is responsible for setting direction for Apple CPUs towards high performance futuristic micro-architecture ideas. We want to push the boundaries of CPU performance to enhance user experience on Apple products through advanced CPU performance features.In this role you will:â¢ Solve performance problems involving branch prediction, data/code prefetching, cache hierarchy or other CPU areas.â¢ Build the right tools suited for performance bottleneck analysis so that you can parse through the noise and focus on the real problem.â¢ Apply state of the art AI/ML techniques to solve CPU performance issues as necessary.â¢ Conduct continuous research into one or more CPU areas and provide guidance to Apple CPU design team on features that should be implemented in future CPUs.â¢ Present analysis/findings to CPU architecture and design teams.â¢ Provide recommendations and influence the roadmap for future Apple CPUs used in iPhone, iPad and Mac systems. Education & Experience PhD in Computer Science or Computer Engineering with focus on Computer Architecture. Role Number: 200264797",
