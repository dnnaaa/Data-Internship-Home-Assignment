Our tech-stack and R&D cultureAs this is a greenfield application, we do not have all the details ironed out, youÂ will help us do that. However, weâll probably be using some of these: â Â  Â  Â Databricks / Apache Spark / Presto / Hive / Athena for data wrangling â Â  Â  Â PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras / Scikit-learn for ML/DL â Â  Â  Â AWSÂ as a cloud provider â Â  Â  Â Python and Jupyter notebooks well, for everything  We will be putting a high emphasis on: â Â  Â  Â Honing your skills â Â  Â  Â Non-blocking automatic MLOps CI/CD pipeline â Â  Â  Â Letting data scientists research and not distract them with endless unneeded meetings â Â  Â  Â Involvement and impact on the decision making process and roadmap of a new product â Â  Â  Â Open-source use and contribution  One of the challenges of data scientists is getting data, youâll have all the data you need, and then some.

You will be an integral part of the design and architecture decision process, working directly with the other team members and leadership (we have a very flat structure). In this role you will have a huge impact on the success of the company. MinimumÂ Qualifications  - At least 4 years of experience as a Data Scientist / Researcher / ML Engineer - Hands-on experience building ML/DLÂ modelsÂ  - Master's degree or equivalent in a STEM fieldÂ   Preferred Qualifications - MLOps and data engineering experience - Familiarity with the DevOps ecosysetm - Experience with NLP, anomaliy detetion - PhD in a STEM fieldÂ ",
