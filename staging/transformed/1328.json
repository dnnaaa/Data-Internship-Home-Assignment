        "description": "Who Are We?Hey there, weâre PricePoint! We make buying and selling moving services simple. When companies have employees transfer from one office to another, or move to a new country for work, the company needs to move that personâs stuff...and the process for pricing those moves has been long outdated.Â  Thatâs why PricePoint was born.Â At our core, weâre a team of problem solvers who identified a big issue in a big industry, and weâve set out to fix it.Â  Our mission is to bring transparency and simplicity to the pricing process for moving peopleâs household goods around the world. Â Â Â We started by building a solution that helped movers automate their pricing and connect to their global partners.Â  After 7 years of onboarding more than 700 movers in over 140 countries onto our system, we expanded to help Relocation Management Companies and Corporations buy those moving services better. Imagine buying something and not knowing how much it costs until weeks later -- thatâs sort of how it works in our industry. PricePoint empowers movers and corporations to make better decisions, speed up the process, save money, and make the lives of the people moving better.Â Â Â PricePoint Is Hiring!You knew that. Thatâs why youâre here! But yes, weâre looking for an incredible engineer and world-class person to join our growing team. We have a ton of new things to build, and over the next year, weâre going to be taking on some serious work: weâll be updating both of our product lines, as well as upgrading our infrastructure to let it handle 10 times the load. Itâs an exciting time to join, and you will be at the center of it all.Some of our challenges will involve solving scalability problems, and improving our automated testing. Whether that means building out a Kubernetes cluster, integrating a load balancer into our deployment process, or improving operational monitoring, we are looking for someone exceptional who is going to roll up their sleeves and make it happen.About You (As a Person):You love technology and you love to build thingsYou want to have a big impact on a growing companyYou like working in small teams and wearing lots of hatsYouâre able to work remotely; perhaps you fancy yourself a âdigital nomadâYouâre a self-starter...we had to say it, itâs in every job description. But also itâs really true about you. Youâre going to work remotely and wear a lot of hats. Self-motivation and the ability to work independently are vital to your success.About You (As an Engineer):You are a great engineer, able to pick up new technologies quickly.You aren't scared of any challenge, you jump in and learn the skills you need to get the job done.You donât like being pigeonholed; you want to work on the full stack from hardware to css.Experience with web application development is a plusJavascript frameworks (angular, react, redux, backbone, ember, etc)Relational databases (mysql, postgres, mssql, oracle)Testing methodologies (test driven development, behavior driven development, unit testing, functional testing)Continuous integration/delivery (build, test, deploy automation, platform as a service)Why Join PricePoint?We are a growing team with big ambitions that believes in being the best at what you do and enjoying life while you do it. Whether it is designing a truly delightful user experience, getting to 100% test coverage, or picking the best mountain for our winter retreat, we like doing things right the first time.And you will wear all of the hats. Joining a small team will give you the opportunity to learn to do everything, from provisioning a new VM to writing the css that lines up that pesky button. Some of the technologies you will work with everyday include: Amazon Web Services (EC2, ELB, RDS, etc.), Kubernetes, NodeJS, React, Redux, Material UI. We believe that a good engineer is someone that can learn any technology, and technologically, we are always looking forward. Youâll be the person at the heart of all of that as we grow and evolve.Where Are We? All Over The World.Â Here at PricePoint, our team is completely remote. With team members in four different countries, and our customers spread all around the world, we offer the incredible opportunity to work from wherever you like. That opportunity, though, requires a special type of person. Global collaboration is at the core of what we do, so weâve built our team with good communicators who can also handle things on their own. If youâre someone like that, youâll fit in well here.The Fine PrintThis is a full-time, salaried position. We provide funding for healthcare and unlimited vacation days to our full time employees at PricePoint: if you need time off, just mark it in your google calendar. Donât schedule time off when weâve got a big event coming up...but, then again, thatâs not the type of person you are.Â Â We are still in startup mode, so youâll probably receive a bottle of Don Julio 1942 Tequila upon joining the company (itâs become a tradition...and donât say you donât like tequila until youâve tried it), but unfortunately a 401k isnât happening all that soon. In due time.At PricePoint, weâre proud to be an equal opportunity employer, and take seriously the opportunity to employ people of all races, genders, orientations, and backgrounds in accordance with all applicable laws.Â Â Ready to Take the Next Steps?Weâre looking to grow quickly, so if you think you are a great fit to be a great member of our team, please contact Neal Siebert at neal@pricepointmoves.com, send your resume and a brief cover letter, and let's set up a time to talk.Â ",
