You'll have deep product ownership and be an important stakeholder as we plan new features.   \n  - Help us build the processes and tools we need to take things to the next level.   \n   Requirements  - 4+ years professional software development experience.   \n  - Strong knowledge of JavaScript and web technology.   \n  - Experience writing unit & integration tests.   \n   Nice to have  - Experience building performant native iOS apps   \n  - Experience with TypeScript, Flow, or a strongly-typed language.   \n  - Experience with React or another component-driven framework.   \n  - Experience building distributed, scalable systems.   \n  - We\u2019re a distributed team, but we do have an office in NYC that you\u2019re able to work from if you\u2019re in the area.",
