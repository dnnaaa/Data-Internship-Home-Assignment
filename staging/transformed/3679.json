A position is available for an individual with skills in data science, bioinformatics and software engineering to play the key role in running and managing the Mount Sinai Data Commons â known as the Data Ark.  The Data Ark team brings together all the most important data sets used by Sinai researchers (e.g. 1000G, GTEx, UK Biobank) in a single location on our HPC server (minvera.org), performs QA/QC processing of the data, conducts initial demographics analyses to showcase the different data sets, and will be tasked with expanding the data commons to host a large range of different data sets of different types (genotype, WES, WGS, RNA-seq, EHR-linked, imaging etc.), which will come with their own computational and platform challenges.  The Data Ark will manage, process and combine data in ways that optimize the accuracy, power and generalizability of science performed at Mount Sinai. By ensuring that Sinai investigators perform science on the same large data resource, the Data Ark should enhance collaboration and advance the pace of scientific advances made at Mount Sinai. We consider this a critical initiative for our institute and hope that it can act as a template for how open, big data science can be operationalized at an institute level.Â Specific job duties are outlined below.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Manage the Data Ark server space, creating an efficient file structure and providing user-access according to the specific restrictions of the different data setsÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Survey the Mount Sinai community to prioritize data sets for uploading to the Data ArkÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Perform quality assurance and quality control on the data sets so that they are âanalysis-readyâ for the vast majority of user casesÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Perform demographic data analyses to showcase the characteristics of specific data sets to convey the benefits of using the different data setsÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Manage the Data Ark website and its growing contentÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Contribute to the expansion of the Data Ark to different data types and to facilitating the linkage between different data sources (e.g. genetic, EHR etc.)Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Performs other related dutiesÂ as assignedRequirements:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The post holder will have a highly quantitative, computational background and be extremely familiar with managing, processing and analyzing large complex data sets of different types.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Bachelor's in Computer Science, Science or related fieldÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The post holder will have strong skills and experience working in a Unix-based environmental, ideally involving the management of server space, and an excellent understanding big data science, preferably having performed research projects on large complex data.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The ability to communicate clearly and present the structure and content of the data commons as it develops in the future will be critical, given the wide spectrum of investigators at Mount Sinai who will interact with the resource.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The post holder should be able to work extremely well on their own and have the initiative and vision to take the Data Ark forwards in ways that will most empower science and medical advances at Mount Sinai.For details on the institute: http://datascience.icahn.mssm.eduÂ Â Strength Through DiversityÂ The Mount Sinai Health System believes that diversity, equity and inclusion are drivers for excellence.
