        "description": "Site Reliability Engineer ManagerÂ The SRE Manager will lead a small team dedicated to proactively building reliability into the Digital Experience platform that is comprised of many complex & integrated systems that leverage multiple programming languages, third-party services, networks andÂ SaaSÂ integrations.Â The SRE manager will be tasked with improving the overall observability and support of the applications and infrastructure.Â In addition, the manager will need a breadth of knowledge and an ability to pull different technology disciplines and soft skills together for the common goal âÂ proactively building resilienceÂ into IT infrastructure and applications.Â The manager will build a team with the troubleshooting and scripting skills to improve the monitoring, availability, performance, and security of customer-facing services and ensure they are designed for 24x7 availability.Â Focuses of site reliability engineering include automation,Â system design, and improvements toÂ system resilience.Core responsibilities:1.) People managementAlong with the normal administrative work required from a people manager, SRE managers need to know how different disciplines can come together on an SRE team. Oftentimes, SRE teams will act somewhat independently from other engineering teams and need to work with some level of autonomy. However, itâs important that site reliability engineering managers are also well-connected with the broader IT, engineering and business teams â staying up-to-date on feature development and how it could affect the systemâs overall reliability.2.) SettingÂ SLOs, SLAs, and SLIsService-level objectives, service-level agreements and service-level indicators are essential to SRE teams. The site reliability engineering manager will define what it means for the system to be âavailableâ and dictate the availability SLO (internal metrics) of the system. Then, the SRE manager needs to provide an SLA to business teams and the rest of engineering to show how much availability they can promise to customers. Then, the team can start to track SLIs to evaluate whether the system is meeting the required percentage of availability.3.) Project planning and prioritizationSite reliability engineering managers are also in charge of project planning and task prioritization. Itâs important that SRE managers sit in on quarterly planning and sprint planning with the greater engineering and IT teams. Then, the site reliability engineering manager can assess the key objectives for the next few sprints and pass those priorities to the rest of theÂ SRE team. This way, the SRE team can begin building features and functions that proactively monitor the health of new features, communicate observations to the rest of the team and add reliability to the overall architecture.4.) Improving the on-call incident response processThe SRE manager will also play a role in scaling and optimizing the overallÂ on-call process.Â Because incident response is such a major part of maintaining uptime and handling reliable services, the SRE manager will be an important part of the cross-functional effort to investigate and remediate issues that impact or could impact service delivery.Â The SRE team will take ownership of setting on-call rotations, alert rules, communication methods andÂ incident response plans.5.) Opening up communication channelsThe Site Reliability Engineering manager will have visibility into how teams across engineering and IT are working and can establish communication best practices throughout the entire software development lifecycle.Â The SRE team will track the effectiveness of these practices and iterate when necessary.6.) Improving service observabilityInÂ Googleâs SRE eBook, they laid out theÂ four golden signals of SRE monitoring. The four golden signals include latency, traffic, error rate and saturation. While these signals are only the start of building a highly observable system, implementing the four golden signals is a great start for any SRE manager. Observability is crucial for enabling site reliability engineers to identify areas for improvement, prioritize future work and learn from the way their system behaves.7.) Proactively testing the flexibility and resilience of the systemSite reliability engineering managers should proactively run tests through their applications and infrastructure.Â This will help uncover faults and limitations that can then be addressed to further enhance system reliability.Â Other responsibilities:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Utilize your Coding and Automation of Applications to implement automated tests, automated deployments, and operational tools for a hybrid on-prem/cloud platform.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Collaborate with Operations, Engineering, and Support teams to troubleshoot issues and implement a program of continuous improvement to maximize service uptime.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Set Strategic and Operational goals and work with the team to deliver on goals.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Implementation of proactive monitoring, alerting, trend analysis and self-healing system.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Participate in on-call rotations, driving restoration and repair of service-impacting issuesÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Define non-functional requirements as part of the product lifecycle to influence the new designs, standards, and methods for scalable, highly available distributed systemsÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Contribute to product development / engineering as needed to ensure Quality of Service of Highly Available servicesÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Take a command-and-control role as Incident Manager during critical incidents focusing on minimizing MTTR & MTTD Identify, evaluate and execute preventive measures to minimize/avoid impact to the customers experience.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Proactive v/s Incident driven Participate in After Action Reviews and facilitate Root Cause Analysis to drive the repair of Problem Records in order to prevent recurrence through to closure including, but not limited to, resolution of product/service defects or design changes, infrastructure changes, or operational changesÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Partner with SREs and lead by example â as this will be a new team, the manager should also be a hands-on contributor initially.Â Required Skill set:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5+ years of Systems/Applications automation in 24x7 Production Services environmentsÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â BS in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Math, or equivalent professional experienceÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Fluency with at least one current generation scripting language used by DevOps professionals (Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby), Java Development and/or .NETÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Excellent troubleshooter, utilizing a systematic problem-solving approach spanning code, systems, and network theory & protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP) ability to read a packet capture/tcpdump, etc.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Experience in designing, analyzing, and diagnosing large-scale distributed systems + Windows Server and/or Linux systems internals (system libraries, file systems, client-server protocols)Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Experience with elastically scalable, fault tolerance and other cloud architecture patterns Experience operating on AWS (both PaaS and IaaS offerings)Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Experience in both Windows (2k8R2+) and Linux (centos) + Security triage & forensic analysisÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Experience with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery concepts, including Infrastructure as code utilizing tools like Terraform, Cloudformation and Chef/SaltStackÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Familiarity with Containerization concepts like Docker, and PaaS services on AWS NoSQL/Docker/Micro-services/Forensic-Analysis experience is a big plusÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Proven strength in SaaS services, experience in massive scale web operationsDesired skill set:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ServiceNow, APM, Log Aggregation, Network Analysis, ITIL/ITSM, CI/CD, Ansible AutomationType: Direct HireLocation: US Remote",
