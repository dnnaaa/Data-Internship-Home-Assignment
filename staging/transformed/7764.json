Who We AreTruckLabs is a technology company on a mission to transform the trucking industry through connected hardware and innovative software products. We apply advanced engineering and data science techniques to partner with the most advanced fleets in the country to improve their real-world fuel economy - driving bottom line savings and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&amp;nbsp;Our first product, TruckWings\u2122, is the industry\u2019s first active aerodynamics product for Class 8 trucks that automatically closes the tractor-trailer gap at highway speeds. Deployed across major national fleets, TruckWings have completed over 250 million miles of highway driving.&amp;nbsp;TruckWings are controlled by a proprietary cloud-connected telematics device which both operates and measures the performance of TruckWings and the trucks.&amp;nbsp;With these technologies, we are making a dent in the 300M metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions produced annually by tractor-trailers, while also increasing the profitability of our customers.
