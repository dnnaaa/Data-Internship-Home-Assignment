        "description": "Solve Finance is an independent debt advisor transforming an industry built on lead-generation and hidden cost business models.

So no referral fees or advice you can\u2019t rely on.

We use Jamstack and leverage Google Cloud Platform serverless compute, big data, and AI capabilities.&amp;nbsp;   We are primarily a Javascript shop (Node/React), but are always open to using the right tool for the job.
