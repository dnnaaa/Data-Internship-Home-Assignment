Remember how you felt when you actually played it, and twitchy animations, sub-par AI and characters that seem to have no perception of the world around them shattered your dream? Itâs time to put a stop to this!Our team in EA Vancouver is a central group devoted to advancing the fields of character animation and AI in EA games: we work towards a (near) future where animation, physics and AI all play together to create realistic and compelling characters. Our technology is shared across multiple games in EA including FIFA, Madden, NHL, UFC, Battlefield and many others: talk about getting in game credits, hey?We are looking for passionate research engineers to join us, using Machine Learning (amongst other things!) to push the boundaries of animation quality and help bring our characters to life!ResponsibilitiesStay up to date with academic development in the field of Machine LearningPropose and develop novel ML based solutions to solve problems in character animation, agent behavior and content generationDesign and implement Machine Learning solutions that consider game development requirements:Usable workflows that minimize human interventionLow impact runtime complexity Collaborate with content creators and other software engineers to ensure that our tools are maintainable, effective and easy to useMinimum QualificationsBachelorâs degree in computer science, applied math, statistics, machine learning or equivalentStrong knowledge and practical experience with C/C++Strong knowledge of linear algebra, statistics, and optimizationStrong knowledge of Machine Learning:At least 1-2 years of experience in the field with a demonstrated practical approach to problem solvingTensorflow, PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy and similarFocus on Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches to improve character animation Preferred QualificationsMasterâs degree and/or Ph.D. in computer science, applied math, statistics, machine learning or equivalent1-2 years of experience in game developmentNon-Technical RequirementsHigh standards of work and desire to meet and exceed expectationsStrong teamwork skills but also the ability to take ownership and work independentlyGood communication skillsPassion for making games look and play greatWe love RL.
