Our recipe includes love of all people, fiscal responsibility, and targeting the root causes of poverty. Our purpose includes human transformation for the most vulnerable and for the donors who support them.Â Â Â And the impact is real. Every day we see donorsâ hearts draw closer to the heart God has for children, families, and communities affected by poverty and injustice. The work you'll do here will help make it possible that every 60 seconds a family gets water, a hungry child is fed, and a family gets the tools they need to overcome poverty.Â Â 03Â TheÂ Jobâ¯Â Â We are looking for aÂ seasonedÂ data scientistÂ with a passion for applying machine learningÂ and building solutionsÂ thatÂ inspireÂ ourÂ donorsÂ andÂ provideÂ a better life forÂ hundreds ofÂ thousands of children inÂ 100 countries.Â You will be joiningÂ aÂ team ofÂ two otherÂ data scientists who have been given executive level support toÂ expandÂ machine learningÂ forÂ marketingÂ and fundraisingÂ initiatives.Â Responsibilities include:â¯Â â¯Â HelpingÂ defineÂ our evolvingÂ visionÂ and tacticsÂ ofÂ machine learning for all World Vision marketing functions.Â Â LeveragingÂ automated machine learning, as well asÂ programming,Â toÂ takeÂ predictive models from ideation to feature creation,Â training,Â and implementation.Â Â Monitoring andÂ managing models over timeÂ to ensure we are continually putting our best foot forward for our faithful donors.Â Â Â Serving asÂ analytical consultantsÂ to our marketers by settingÂ up andÂ readingÂ market tests,Â producing actionable insights fromÂ deep-dive analyses, andÂ applying best practices inÂ information visualization.Â ApplyingÂ sound statisticsÂ that help the organization makeÂ reliableÂ data-drivenÂ decisions.Â Â Â KeepingÂ Christ centralÂ in our individual and corporate lives. AttendingÂ and participatingÂ in weekly devotions, chapel services, and regular prayer.â¯Â 04Â You BringÂ â¯Â Heart for serviceÂ because we are not just working with data, we are working with valuable donor dollars andÂ impactingÂ the livelihood ofÂ the worldâs neediestÂ children.Â Â Team spiritÂ because we try to learn from each person and function as a body of Christ, not a lone rangerÂ or unicorn. Yet you also bring aÂ âfigure it outâ attitudeÂ because you areÂ anÂ independent and resourcefulÂ adult.Â Â Passion for continual learningÂ because our industry,Â our organization,Â and the data science worldÂ willÂ never stop changing.Â Creative problem solvingÂ with machine learning and the fortitude to follow through to the endÂ becauseÂ our data and our projectsÂ wonât beÂ easy.Â Â Real-world experience in marketing data scienceÂ (including digitalÂ marketing). This means you can build models, but have also wrestled with defining training sets, creating features,Â and monitoring models over timeÂ becauseÂ you knowÂ the building part is only the tip of the iceberg.Â Â Fluency inÂ SQL and PythonÂ to pull and transform data, conduct descriptive analysis,Â and performÂ machine learning.Â There will be a lot of coding for sure and it wonât always be the glamorous machine learning type.Â FamiliarityÂ withÂ automated machine learningÂ because weâreÂ a non-profit trying to do more with less byÂ embracingÂ DatarobotÂ to doÂ the work of 5x more people than weÂ actually have.Â Â Excellent verbal and written communication skillsÂ that resonate with lay peopleÂ becauseÂ youâll be working with marketers who put tremendous value in words and images.Â Â 05Â Where this job could take your careerÂ Â World Vision USAÂ is a part of the larger World Vision International partnership. Globally, we have nearly 35,000 staff working in nearly 100 countries. Just over 900 of us call World Vision USA home. You'll have opportunities to advance within our robust and talented group ofÂ professionals as you continue to stretch and grow your career for the future.Â Â 06Â Let your work be your faith in actionÂ Â Every day, nearly 16,000 children under the age of 5 die from preventable causes. Our call to action is urgent. Thatâs why weâre looking for someone who is ready to place their expertise behind helping the worldâs most vulnerable children.
