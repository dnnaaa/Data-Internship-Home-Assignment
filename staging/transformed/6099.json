We are a small, expert, cross-functional team made of data engineers and SREs. We are building a fairly large platform that other teams ranging from autopilot to service technicians leverage to collect and access data. We are already processing trillions of events per day but with more and more cars on the road, more and more Superchargers, Powerwalls, solar installations, new factories in China and Europe, and, of course, new products coming to markets, we need to think about scaling up our hybrid infrastructure to the next level.      What we are building     - We are building a hybrid platform with on-prem datacenters and public clouds in multiple regions.   \n  - Our stack is fairly modern.
