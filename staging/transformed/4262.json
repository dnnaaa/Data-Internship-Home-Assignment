Some may think we\u2019re \u201cold\u201d (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we\u2019re also a software company. And a security company.

But \u201cDigital Transformation\u201d is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
