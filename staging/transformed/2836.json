We need engineers who are comfortable with pre-production work, rather than working on existing systems.Â Description:We are looking for aÂ machine learning engineer with a focus on rapid prototyping and pre-production development to build innovative solutions for the Productivity team. The ML Engineer will become an integral part of the Productivity and D10X team. Our teams work with businesses to solve hard problems that require experimentation, an outside-in perspective, and experience navigating ambiguity.Â Job Background/context:The objective of the job is to create, experiment, and put in place rapid prototypes and initial MVPs where solution hypothesis generation and testing is done with tangible throwaway proofs-of-concept and rapidly implemented solutions.
